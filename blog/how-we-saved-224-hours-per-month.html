            <div class="article-content">
                <p>It’s the second week of December. I have been working as a remote Operations Specialist for startups for the last three years. It’s been nearly two years since I left my full-time role as Operations Manager in the Logistics Management sector to pusue my career as an entrepreneur. Honestly, it’s been the best years of my professional career. Rewarding as it is demanding. It taught me a great many things, but resilience and frugality are the ones that stand out the most.</p>

                <p>Frugality.</p>
            
                <p>A word completely foreign to me prior to being introduced to the infamous book <a href="[https://theleanstartup.com/#principles](https://theleanstartup.com/#principles)" target="The Lean Startup">The Lean Startup</a>. As it is, I learnt that startups are not the golden goose of careers. They are prone to failure due to an infinite number of reasons. But as I see things, it's what the founders walk away with and how they walk away that builds or breaks them. Oh, boy, did it build us!</p>

                <p>So here I am, more or less half a year without work. Credit maxed on loans to keep the lights on. Driving for <a href="[https://bolt.eu/](https://bolt.eu/)" target="Bolt">Bolt</a> (not Uber <a href="[https://www.uber.com/](https://www.uber.com/)" target="Uber">Uber</a>) 16 hours a day, seven days a week. Compound onto this, having my phone stolen when picking up a rider one Sunday. The tool crucial to my primary source of income - snatched away.</p>

                <p>I’ve applied to over 600 relevant jobs across countless job platforms - that’s a realistic estimate, I stopped keeping track at 300+ applications - and most, if not all, either responded with “Unfortunately we won’t be moving forward…” or just plain silence. I was on my last month’s salary that I could pull from the loan and receiving some buffer cash as favors from colleagues who worked alongside me in the startup space out of pure good will.</p>

                <h2>The Pivot</h2>
                <p>I was winding down after another hard day on the road when my phone lit up - an email. I had a look and it was a response from an HR manager from one of the roles I’ve applied for earlier that week. It was an offer for me to attend an interview.  The rates and hours were predefined already; but it was on the low end for a fulltime role. I asked if the rates were negotiable and they immediately doubled it. That’s when I knew that I had to take the opportunity.</p>

                <p>Fast forward into 2025 and I've been with <a href="[https://akivagoldman.com/](https://akivagoldman.com/)" target="Goldman & Associates Family Law Firm">Goldman & Associates Family Law Firm</a> as Operations Director for about 6 months, focusing on Legal sector operations. At this point, I have more or less mastered the new Project Management software - <a href="[https://www.smartsheet.com/](https://www.smartsheet.com/)" target="Smartsheet">Smartsheet</a> - that the Firm adopted in December the previous year. What I noticed was that the majority of the staff were using the software as a glorified spreadsheet and missing out on its true potential. I joined in this role to identify and unlock potential, driving Operational Excellence.</p>

                <p>I realized that, despite our best intentions in setting up a comprehensive project and task management dashboard, the system was still fragmented and tedious. So much so that logging a single project took up to 10 min if you followed the SOP Development to the letter. I’m not blameless in this regard. Since I rolled the templates out in quarter one, I had first-hand experience with how it works. Albeit, I would say that the process of tracking projects has changed significantly since the original rollout. Adding layers upon layers of complexity. Some of these changes I agreed with. Others I did not. Ultimately, I did not make the final call.</p>

                <p>One afternoon, looking at the system that we have built, I felt that it’s time for a change. I grabbed a coffee and kicked off what would become one of the pinnacle advancements of my mid-career journey. I won’t bore you with the intricacies of how I got there. In short, I leveraged OpenAI’s GPT-4o model and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, with reasoning, against each other. The goal: to analyze and drive process improvement for the current project tracking system we had in place and not merely improve it, but make it the industry standard. The result: a tracking system that is fully automated, accepts a single point of entry, and deploys data visability of tasks being worked on across the entire Firm. It zooms in to an individual level dashboard and all the way out. To a global scale where the senior team can see every metric, backlog, dependency, load balancing, and completion ratios to inform their Strategic Planning. But what is an idea without action?</p>

                <p>And so, I took action.</p>

                <h3>The System</h3>
                <p>Now that I had my trusty tools do the brunt of the brainstorming for me, I had a framework to launch from. As with any new process that I analyze, I architected wireframes of how data processing will flow. From the trigger (user input) through every moving part and to the dashboard (output).</p>

                <p>This helps in two ways.</p>

                <p>Firstly, the wireframing forces my mind to understand the process as a whole from a big picture perspective, a key aspect of Systems Thinking, without needing to narrow down to the last detail. My mind is naturally detail-obsessed, so this saves me a great deal of time, keeping things ‘high-level’. Secondly, it serves as a visual roadmap for my Cross-Functional Teams when orchestrating the deployment of the new process.</p>
            
                <p>The next step was to map out the process in writing, giving context to the wireframes. This helped condense the twenty-odd pages of brainstorming notes that I had into a more digestible version. Without this step, my team and I would have spent hours in virtual conference rooms reminding each other how everything fits together. It gave just the right amount of detail, broken down into steps, allowing my team to execute with minimal input.</p>

                <p>Finally I laid down the roadmap. I allotted three weeks for the project development and deployment. Below is a small excerp from my notes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Week 1: Foundation Setup</li>
                    <li>Week 2: Automation & Reporting</li>
                    <li>Week 3: Dashboards & Go-Live</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Results</h3>
                <p>In reality, it took three and a half weeks due to a mix of pushback from various departments, a natural part of Change Management, and getting the final training documentation in place. The pushback? Teams were concerned when they heard ‘automation’ that their jobs would be at stake. These concerns, valid in their own regard, were alleviated as we explained the purpose of incorporating AI technologies in the Firm. With the goal being to eliminate redundant or repetitive tasks by handing them over to a machine and reinvesting our human resources into higher-stake processes where machines cannot be trusted to run autonomously.</p>

                <p class="image-caption">Our workflow automation reduced manual task tracking by 80%</p>


                <p>The launch of the new project tracking system kicked off in the first week of July and has since saved nearly 500 hours at the time of writing across 85 virtual employees and 11 internal departments, demonstrating the value of KPI Tracking. When I first joined, management were adverse to the use of AI tools with the primary concern being around privacy and security. But when the director attended a LegalTech conference in January speaking about the benefits of AI in law firms, something clicked. It sparked, one of the most significant shifts in the firm’s 25 year tenure.</p>

                <p>Being the largest Michigan-based family law firm also means you need to stay ahead of the market. This project is one of many ways in which I added an edge for businesses globally, driving their Digital Transformation.</p>

                <h3>Key Takeaways for your Team</h3>
                <p>Sure, you might say that I took a shortcut when I used artificial intelligence to come up with these improvements. You are right, to a degree, but the key is how you use the technology to your advantage. Approximately 79% of Americans are not yet considered “<a href="[https://sparktoro.com/blog/new-research-20-of-americans-use-ai-tools-10x-month-but-growth-is-slowing-and-traditional-search-hasnt-dipped/](https://sparktoro.com/blog/new-research-20-of-americans-use-ai-tools-10x-month-but-growth-is-slowing-and-traditional-search-hasnt-dipped/)" target="heavy users">heavy users</a>” of AI tools, using large language models (LLMs) as a glorified or complementary search engine (think Google search on steroids) or with basic, vague prompts. According to Statista Market Insights surveys, the daily AI usage is expected to reach <a href="[https://altindex.com/news/global-ai-adoption-to-surge](https://altindex.com/news/global-ai-adoption-to-surge)" target="378 million globally">source</a> by the end of 2025.</p>

                <p>Why do I bring this up you may ask? AI is what the Internet was to society over two decades ago when it was first introduced. We are at the forefront of the Fourth Technological Revolution (4IR). There are two choices society are faced with. Sit back and observe how the technology shapes the workplace and job market, or get involved and get some digital dirt under your fingernails.</p>

                <p>I leverage these AI Integrations, among countless others, to improve my productivity levels. I don’t view the model as my personal assistant ready to do my bidding, but rather as a strategic thinking partner. One who can crunch large amount of data in a fraction of the time that a human could ever dream of. The key differentiator between “regular users” and “heavy users” is in the how and the what we do with these tools and the information it gives us. Never take the information an AI gives you at face value. Always verify the numbers, the facts, the final result.</p>

                <p>I leave you with this thought. Think of one business process in your business that devours vast amounts of resources. It is very likely that your employees or even yourself, if you are a small business owner, despises the tasks connected to this process, but it is absolutely critical to your survival. This is where Business Process Improvement comes in. What would you say if I told you that I could help you slice the liability of that process by up to 90%; be it time, money, people, whatever the case might be. Would you be adverse to incorporating some level of automation?</p>

                <p>The digital race for businesses to become more efficient and reduce operating expenses has begun. Most are oblivious to the race. Are you?</p>
